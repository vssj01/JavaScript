# setTimeout + Closures Interview Question üî• | Namaste üôè JavaScript Ep. 11 - YouTube

## Key Insights

- **Understanding Closures with setTimeout**:

  - Closures in JavaScript can be tricky, especially when used with `setTimeout`.
  - The `setTimeout` function does not wait at the point of its invocation. Instead, it schedules a callback function to be executed after a specified delay.
  - The callback function retains a reference to variables in its lexical scope, forming a closure.

- **Common Misconception**:

  - Many developers think `setTimeout` will block the execution at the point of its call. However, JavaScript does not wait for `setTimeout` to complete. It moves on to the next line of code immediately.

- **Example 1: Basic setTimeout**:

  ```javascript
  function x() {
    var i = 1;
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
  }
  x(); // Prints 1 after 1 second
  ```

- **Example 2: setTimeout in a Loop with var**:

  ```javascript
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i);
    }, i * 1000);
  }
  // Prints 6 five times, each after 1 second interval
  ```

  - This happens because the `i` in the callback function refers to the same variable in memory, which ends up being 6 after the loop completes.

- **Fix with let**:

  ```javascript
  for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i);
    }, i * 1000);
  }
  // Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds respectively
  ```

  - Using `let` creates a new scope for each iteration of the loop, resulting in separate variables for each callback function.

- **Fix with Closures and var**:
  ```javascript
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    (function (i) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
      }, i * 1000);
    })(i);
  }
  // Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds respectively
  ```
  - Creating an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) inside the loop captures the current value of `i` and forms a closure with the callback function, ensuring the correct value is logged.

## Code Snippets for Interviews

1. **Basic Closure Example**:

   ```javascript
   function createClosure() {
     var i = 1;
     return function () {
       console.log(i);
     };
   }
   var closure = createClosure();
   closure(); // Prints 1
   ```

2. **setTimeout with let**:

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
     setTimeout(function () {
       console.log(i);
     }, i * 1000);
   }
   ```

3. **setTimeout with Closure and var**:
   ```javascript
   for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
     (function (i) {
       setTimeout(function () {
         console.log(i);
       }, i * 1000);
     })(i);
   }
   ```

## Understanding closures and how they interact with `setTimeout` is crucial for handling asynchronous behavior in JavaScript. Mastery of these concepts will help you solve complex problems and impress interviewers.

## CRAZY JS INTERVIEW ü§Øft. Closures | Namaste üôè JavaScript Ep. 12 - YouTube

---

**00:26 - What is a Closure in JavaScript?**

- **Question**: What is a Closure in JavaScript?
- **Answer**: A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

  **Explanation**:

  - In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created.
  - A closure gives the ability to maintain state and access variables in a specific scope.

  ```javascript
  function outerFunction() {
    let outerVar = "I am outside!";

    function innerFunction() {
      console.log(outerVar); // Accesses outerVar from outerFunction's scope
    }

    return innerFunction;
  }

  const closure = outerFunction();
  closure(); // Logs: "I am outside!"
  ```

**01:34 - Can you give an example of a Closure in JS?**

- **Question**: Can you give an example of a Closure in JavaScript?
- **Answer**: Sure, here is a detailed example of a closure:

  **Example**:

  - The following example demonstrates how closures work by encapsulating variables.

  ```javascript
  function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;

    return function () {
      count++;
      return count;
    };
  }

  const counter = createCounter();
  console.log(counter()); // Logs: 1
  console.log(counter()); // Logs: 2
  ```

**03:29 - Use of double parenthesis `()()` in JS**

- **Question**: What is the use of double parenthesis `()()` in JavaScript?
- **Answer**: Double parenthesis is used to immediately invoke a function that returns another function and then invoke the returned function.

  **Explanation**:

  - This pattern is known as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).

  ```javascript
  function outerFunction() {
    return function innerFunction() {
      console.log("Hello from inner function");
    };
  }

  outerFunction()(); // Logs: "Hello from inner function"
  ```

**05:25 - Are Let declarations closed over?**

- **Question**: Are `let` declarations closed over?
- **Answer**: Yes, `let` declarations are closed over just like `var` and `const`.

  **Explanation**:

  - Closures can capture variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const` as part of the lexical environment.

  ```javascript
  function exampleClosure() {
    let letVariable = "I am a let variable";

    return function () {
      console.log(letVariable);
    };
  }

  const closure = exampleClosure();
  closure(); // Logs: "I am a let variable"
  ```

**06:15 - Are function parameters closed over?**

- **Question**: Are function parameters closed over?
- **Answer**: Yes, function parameters are also closed over just like variables declared within a function.

  **Explanation**:

  - Parameters are part of the function‚Äôs scope, and thus can be accessed by any inner function.

  ```javascript
  function exampleClosure(param) {
    return function () {
      console.log(param);
    };
  }

  const closure = exampleClosure("I am a parameter");
  closure(); // Logs: "I am a parameter"
  ```

**07:45 - Relation of Scope Chain and Closures**

- **Question**: What is the relation of the scope chain and closures?
- **Answer**: Closures maintain references to their scope chain even after the parent function has executed.

  **Explanation**:

  - This means closures have access to variables and functions defined in the parent scopes.

  ```javascript
  function outerFunction() {
    let outerVar = "Outer";

    function innerFunction() {
      let innerVar = "Inner";
      console.log(outerVar); // Accesses outerVar from outerFunction's scope
    }

    return innerFunction;
  }

  const closure = outerFunction();
  closure(); // Logs: "Outer"
  ```

**10:25 - Conflicting name Global variables in JS**

- **Question**: What happens with conflicting global variable names in JavaScript?
- **Answer**: If a variable defined inside a function conflicts with a global variable name, the function's variable shadows the global variable.

  **Explanation**:

  - JavaScript resolves the variable in the closest scope first, then searches the outer scopes.

  ```javascript
  var globalVar = "Global";

  function testConflict() {
    var globalVar = "Local";
    console.log(globalVar); // Logs: "Local"
  }

  testConflict();
  console.log(globalVar); // Logs: "Global"
  ```

**13:25 - Advantages of Closure**

- **Question**: What are the advantages of using closures?
- **Answer**: Closures offer several advantages such as:
  - Data encapsulation and privacy.
  - Maintaining state across invocations.
  - Implementing function factories.

**14:24 - Data Hiding & Encapsulation in JavaScript?**

- **Question**: Explain Data Hiding & Encapsulation in JavaScript?
- **Answer**: Data hiding and encapsulation can be achieved using closures.

  **Explanation**:

  - By using closures, internal details of an implementation are hidden from the external world.

  ```javascript
  function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;

    return {
      increment: function () {
        count++;
        return count;
      },
      getCount: function () {
        return count;
      },
    };
  }

  const counter = createCounter();
  console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
  console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
  ```

**14:59 - Example of Data Privacy using Closures**

- **Question**: Can you show an example of data privacy using closures?
- **Answer**: Here is an example:

  **Example**:

  - The counter example demonstrates data privacy using closures.

  ```javascript
  function secretCounter() {
    let secretCount = 0;

    return {
      increment: function () {
        secretCount++;
        return secretCount;
      },
    };
  }

  const myCounter = secretCounter();
  console.log(myCounter.increment()); // Logs: 1
  console.log(typeof secretCount); // Logs: "undefined"
  ```

**21:10 - Function Constructor in JavaScript**

- **Question**: What is a function constructor in JavaScript?
- **Answer**: A function constructor is a regular function used to create instances of objects.

  **Explanation**:

  - It typically uses the `this` keyword to assign properties and methods.

  ```javascript
  function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  const john = new Person("John", 25);
  console.log(john.name); // John
  console.log(john.age); // 25
  ```

**25:02 - Disadvantages of Closures?**

- **Question**: What are the disadvantages of closures?
- **Answer**: Some disadvantages include:
  - Memory leaks: If not managed properly, closures can lead to increased memory usage.
  - Debugging can be harder due to retention of outer variables.

**26:02 - What is a Garbage Collector in JavaScript?**

- **Question**: What is a Garbage Collector in JavaScript?
- **Answer**: A garbage collector is a mechanism that automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use by the program.

  **Explanation**:

  - JavaScript's garbage collector works by identifying and freeing memory that is unreachable.

**27:25 - Relation between Garbage Collection, Memory Leaks, and Closures?**

- **Question**: What is the relation between Garbage Collection, Memory Leaks, and Closures?
- **Answer**: Closures can sometimes prevent garbage collection if they maintain references to unneeded variables, leading to memory leaks.

  **Explanation**:

  - Closures keep their references alive, thus these need to be managed to avoid leaks.

**29:42 - Example of Smart Garbage collection by V8 JS Engine in Chrome**

- **Question**: Can you give an example of smart garbage collection by V8 JS Engine in Chrome?
- **Answer**: The V8 engine optimizes garbage collection by identifying and collecting memory from unreachable objects efficiently.

  **Example**:

  - Smart garbage collection ensures that closures do not hold references longer than necessary to optimize memory usage.

  ```javascript
  function outer() {
    let largeArray = new Array(1000000).fill("data");

    return function inner() {
      console.log(largeArray[0]);
    };
  }

  const closure = outer();
  closure();
  // Smart garbage collection will collect `largeArray` once it is no longer needed.
  ```

# FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS üî•ft. Anonymous Functions | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 13

## Key Insights

### Anonymous Functions

- **Definition**: A function without a name.
- **Usage**: Typically used where functions are treated as values.
- **Syntax Error**: Directly creating an anonymous function like a function statement results in a syntax error due to ECMAScript specifications.

### Function Statement vs. Function Expression

- **Function Statement**:
  ```javascript
  function example() {
    console.log("Function statement");
  }
  ```
  - **Hoisting**: Can be called before its definition due to hoisting.
- **Function Expression**:
  ```javascript
  var example = function () {
    console.log("Function expression");
  };
  ```
  - **Hoisting**: Cannot be called before its definition; it will throw an error as it is initially undefined.

### Named Function Expression

- **Definition**: A function expression with a name.
  ```javascript
  var example = function namedFunction() {
    console.log("Named function expression");
  };
  ```
- **Scope**: The function name is only accessible within the function itself.

### Parameters vs. Arguments

- **Parameters**: The identifiers in the function definition.
- **Arguments**: The actual values passed to the function when called.
  ```javascript
  function example(param1, param2) {
    console.log(param1, param2); // Parameters
  }
  example(1, 2); // Arguments
  ```

### First Class Functions

- **Definition**: Functions treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be:

  - Assigned to variables
  - Passed as arguments to other functions
  - Returned from other functions

  ```javascript
  // Assigning to a variable
  var example = function () {
    console.log("Function as a value");
  };

  // Passing as an argument
  function executeFunction(fn) {
    fn();
  }
  executeFunction(example);

  // Returning from a function
  function returnFunction() {
    return function () {
      console.log("Returned function");
    };
  }
  var newFunction = returnFunction();
  newFunction();
  ```

### Additional Notes

- **Function Declaration**: Another term for function statement.
- **First-Class Citizens**: A term indicating functions can be used like any other variable in JavaScript.

## Code Snippets

### Function Statement Example

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### Function Expression Example

```javascript
var greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
};
greet(); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### Named Function Expression Example

```javascript
var greet = function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
};
greet(); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### Anonymous Function Usage

```javascript
var greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
};
greet(); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### First Class Function Example

```javascript
function firstClassExample() {
  return function () {
    console.log("Returned as a first-class function");
  };
}
var newFunction = firstClassExample();
newFunction(); // Output: Returned as a first-class function
```

### Hoisting Difference

```javascript
// Function Statement (Hoisted)
greet(); // Output: Hello, World!
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

// Function Expression (Not Hoisted)
try {
  greet(); // Throws an error
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.message); // Output: greet is not a function
}
var greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
};
```

### Parameters vs. Arguments Example

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  // Parameters
  return a + b;
}
console.log(sum(2, 3)); // Arguments, Output: 5
```

# Callback Functions in JS ft. Event Listeners üî•| Namaste JavaScript Ep. 14 - YouTube

## Key Insights:

- **Introduction to Callback Functions:**

  - **Definition:** A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.
  - **Usage:** Commonly used in asynchronous operations, such as event handling, HTTP requests, and timers.

- **Callback Functions in JavaScript:**

  - **First-Class Functions:** Functions in JavaScript are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
  - **Syntax Example:**

    ```javascript
    function greet(name) {
      console.log("Hello " + name);
    }

    function processUserInput(callback) {
      var name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
      callback(name);
    }

    processUserInput(greet);
    ```

  - **Explanation:** In this example, the `greet` function is passed as a callback to the `processUserInput` function, which then calls `greet` with the user's input.

- **Asynchronous JavaScript with Callbacks:**

  - **setTimeout Example:**

    ```javascript
    function displayMessage() {
      console.log("This message is displayed after 3 seconds");
    }

    setTimeout(displayMessage, 3000);
    ```

  - **Explanation:** `setTimeout` is an example of an asynchronous function that takes a callback function (`displayMessage`) and a delay (3000 milliseconds).

- **Event Listeners with Callbacks:**

  - **Adding Event Listeners:**
    ```javascript
    document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
      alert("Button was clicked!");
    });
    ```
  - **Explanation:** Here, an anonymous callback function is passed to `addEventListener` to handle the button click event.

- **Callback Hell:**

  - **Definition:** Callback hell refers to the situation where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and maintain.
  - **Example:**
    ```javascript
    doSomething(function (result) {
      doSomethingElse(result, function (newResult) {
        doAnotherThing(newResult, function (finalResult) {
          console.log(finalResult);
        });
      });
    });
    ```

- **Best Practices to Avoid Callback Hell:**

  - **Use Named Functions:** Instead of anonymous functions, use named functions to make the code more readable.
  - **Example:**

    ```javascript
    function firstFunction(result) {
      doSomethingElse(result, secondFunction);
    }

    function secondFunction(newResult) {
      doAnotherThing(newResult, thirdFunction);
    }

    function thirdFunction(finalResult) {
      console.log(finalResult);
    }

    doSomething(firstFunction);
    ```

  - **Use Promises:** Promises can help manage asynchronous code more effectively.
  - **Example with Promises:**
    ```javascript
    doSomething()
      .then(doSomethingElse)
      .then(doAnotherThing)
      .then(console.log)
      .catch(console.error);
    ```

- **Conclusion:**
  - **Importance of Callbacks:** Callbacks are crucial in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations and creating interactive web applications.
  - **Practice:** Understanding and practicing callback functions and their applications is essential for mastering JavaScript.

# Asynchronous JavaScript & EVENT LOOP from scratch üî• | Namaste JavaScript Ep.15

## Key Insights from the Video

- **Understanding Event Loop**:

  - The event loop is crucial for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
  - It ensures that non-blocking operations like I/O tasks, timers, and user interactions are managed efficiently.

- **JavaScript Execution Context**:

  - JavaScript code runs inside an execution context.
  - The global execution context is created when the script is loaded.
  - Each function call creates a new execution context, which is placed on the call stack.

- **Call Stack and Web APIs**:

  - The call stack handles function execution order.
  - Web APIs handle asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, HTTP requests, and DOM events.
  - Once an asynchronous operation completes, the callback function is moved to the task queue.

- **Task Queue and Event Loop**:

  - The task queue holds completed asynchronous operations‚Äô callbacks.
  - The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty and then pushes the first callback from the task queue to the call stack for execution.

- **Microtasks and Macrotasks**:
  - Microtasks (e.g., `Promise` callbacks) have higher priority than macrotasks (e.g., `setTimeout`).
  - After each macrotask, all available microtasks are executed before the next macrotask.

## Code Snippets

### Example of Asynchronous Execution using `setTimeout`

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation**:

- The `setTimeout` callback is placed in the task queue after 1 second.
- The event loop waits for the call stack to be empty and then executes the callback.

### Example using Promises

```javascript
console.log("Start");

new Promise((resolve) => {
  console.log("Promise executor");
  resolve("Promise resolved");
}).then((message) => {
  console.log(message);
});

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation**:

- The promise executor runs immediately and synchronously.
- The `then` callback is placed in the microtask queue and executed after the main code and before any macrotasks.

### Comprehensive Event Loop Example

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise callback");
});

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation**:

- `Promise callback` logs before `Timeout callback` due to the microtask priority over macrotasks, despite `setTimeout` having a delay of 0ms.

## Summary

- The video explains the event loop in JavaScript, emphasizing its role in managing asynchronous operations through the call stack, web APIs, task queue, and microtask queue.
- Understanding the distinction between macrotasks and microtasks and their execution order is crucial for efficient asynchronous programming.
- Practical code examples demonstrate the behavior of asynchronous functions and the event loop's operation, preparing developers for handling real-world JavaScript challenges effectively.

# JS Engine EXPOSED üî• Google's V8 Architecture üöÄ | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 16

## Summary:

### Key Insights:

- **Introduction to JavaScript Engine**:

  - The video provides an in-depth look into Google's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - V8 is used in Google Chrome and Node.js to execute JavaScript code efficiently.

- **Understanding JavaScript Engines**:

  - A JavaScript engine is a program or interpreter that executes JavaScript code.
  - Engines like V8 convert JavaScript into machine code for the browser or server to execute.

- **V8 Architecture Overview**:

  - V8 compiles JavaScript into native machine code before executing it.
  - The engine uses two compilers: Full-codegen (for fast initial compilation) and Crankshaft (for optimized code).

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**:

  - JIT compilation is a key feature of V8, combining both interpretation and compilation.
  - Code is first interpreted, then compiled to optimize performance dynamically.

- **Garbage Collection**:
  - V8 includes an efficient garbage collector to manage memory.
  - The garbage collector frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer in use.

### Code Snippets:

#### Example of JavaScript Code Execution in V8:

```javascript
function calculateSquare(number) {
  return number * number;
}

let result = calculateSquare(5);
console.log(result); // Output: 25
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The above code defines a simple function to calculate the square of a number.
  - V8 compiles this code into machine code for efficient execution.

#### Understanding JIT Compilation:

```javascript
// JIT compilation example
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  add(i, i + 1);
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - This code snippet demonstrates JIT compilation, where the function `add` is compiled and optimized for repeated execution.

### Performance Optimization Techniques:

- **Inline Caching**:
  - V8 uses inline caching to speed up property access by remembering the type of objects.
- **Hidden Classes**:
  - V8 creates hidden classes dynamically to optimize object property access.

### Memory Management:

- **Garbage Collector Phases**:
  - The garbage collector in V8 operates in multiple phases to clean up memory:
    1. **Mark Phase**: Identifies live objects.
    2. **Sweep Phase**: Reclaims memory occupied by dead objects.
    3. **Compact Phase**: Defragments the memory.

### Additional Resources:

- **V8 GitHub Repository**: Explore the V8 source code and documentation for more in-depth understanding.
- **V8 Blog**: Follow the V8 team‚Äôs blog for updates on new features and optimizations.

# TRUST ISSUES with setTimeout() | Namaste JavaScript Ep.17

## Key Insights

- **Event Loop and setTimeout()**

  - The `setTimeout()` function in JavaScript is used to delay the execution of a function by a specified time.
  - The exact timing of the callback execution can vary and is influenced by the event loop.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    console.log("Start");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Callback executed after 2 seconds");
    }, 2000);
    console.log("End");
    ```
  - This code may log "Start", "End", and then "Callback executed after 2 seconds", but the exact timing can vary depending on the event loop and other tasks in the queue.

- **Event Loop Mechanics**

  - JavaScript is single-threaded and uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations.
  - The event loop continuously checks the message queue and executes any pending callbacks when the call stack is empty.

- **Callback Function Execution**

  - Callbacks registered with `setTimeout()` are placed in the message queue after the specified delay.
  - The actual execution of these callbacks can be delayed if the call stack is not empty or if other tasks are in the queue.

- **Example Demonstrating Event Loop Behavior**

  - The following code demonstrates the event loop's impact on `setTimeout()`:
    ```javascript
    console.log("Start");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("First callback");
    }, 0);
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {} // Simulating a heavy computation
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Second callback");
    }, 0);
    console.log("End");
    ```
  - Output order: "Start", "End", "First callback", "Second callback".
  - Even though the delay is 0, the heavy computation delays the execution of the first callback.

- **Trust Issues with Timing**
  - The timing of callbacks can be unpredictable due to the event loop and other asynchronous tasks.
  - It is important to understand the non-deterministic nature of `setTimeout()` for precise timing operations.

# Higher-Order Functions ft. Functional Programming | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 18

## Key Insights

- **Introduction to Higher-Order Functions**

  - A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result.
  - These functions are crucial for functional programming in JavaScript.

- **Examples of Higher-Order Functions**

  - **Example 1: Calculate Area**
    - Function to calculate the area of multiple circles.
    - Uses the radius of circles to compute the area using a higher-order function.

  - Many people write repetitive code instead of using modular and reusable functions.
  - Higher-order functions help in writing cleaner and more maintainable code.

- **Functional Programming Concepts**
  - Encourages breaking down logic into smaller, reusable components.
  - Avoids repetition by extracting common logic into higher-order functions.
- **Practical Example: Calculating Area, Circumference, and Diameter**
  - Demonstrates how to use higher-order functions to calculate various properties of circles.

## Code Snippets

### Calculate Area of Circles

```javascript
function calculateArea(radius) {
  return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}

function calculateAreas(radii) {
  return radii.map(calculateArea);
}

let radii = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let areas = calculateAreas(radii);
console.log(areas); // Outputs: [3.14, 12.56, 28.27, 50.24]
```

### Calculate Circumference of Circles

```javascript
function calculateCircumference(radius) {
  return 2 * Math.PI * radius;

function calculateDiameters(radii) {
  return radii.map(calculateDiameter);
}

let diameters = calculateDiameters(radii);
console.log(diameters); // Outputs: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### Generic Higher-Order Function for Circle Properties

```javascript
function calculateCircleProperties(radii, logicFunction) {
  return radii.map(logicFunction);
}

let areas = calculateCircleProperties(radii, calculateArea);
let circumferences = calculateCircleProperties(radii, calculateCircumference);
let diameters = calculateCircleProperties(radii, calculateDiameter);

console.log(areas); // Outputs: [3.14, 12.56, 28.27, 50.24]
console.log(circumferences); // Outputs: [6.28, 12.56, 18.84, 25.12]

## Key Insights

### Introduction to Higher-Order Functions

- **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- **Common Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript:** `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### Map Function

- **Purpose:** Transforms each element in an array using a provided function.
- **Usage:** When you need to perform an operation on every element of an array and create a new array with the transformed values.

#### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((x) => x * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### Filter Function

- **Purpose:** Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- **Usage:** When you need to filter out certain elements from an array based on a condition.

#### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evens = numbers.filter((x) => x % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // Output: [2, 4]
```

### Reduce Function

- **Purpose:** Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
- **Usage:** When you need to aggregate values in an array into a single value.

#### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current, 0);
console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

### Advanced Example

- **Objective:** Calculate the sum of all values in an array using `reduce`.

#### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current, 0);
console.log(sum); // Output: 150
```

### Practical Use Case

- **Example:** Transform an array of user objects to extract their full names.

#### Example

```javascript
const users = [
  { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" },
  { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" },
];
const fullNames = users.map((user) => `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`);
console.log(fullNames); // Output: ['John Doe', 'Jane Doe']
```

### Combining Functions

- **Example:** Filter out numbers greater than 10 and then double the remaining numbers.

#### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20];
const result = numbers.filter((x) => x > 10).map((x) => x * 2);
console.log(result); // Output: [30, 40]
```

## Interview Tips

- Be clear about the purpose and use cases for `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Understand how to combine these functions for more complex operations.
- Practice writing examples to demonstrate your understanding during interviews.
