### Polyfill for bind method | Javascript Interview Questions

**Key Insights:**

- **Introduction to bind Method:**
  - `bind` is a method in JavaScript that allows you to create a new function with a specified `this` context and optional initial arguments.
  - It's commonly used in scenarios where you need to ensure a function retains a specific `this` value, regardless of how it's called.

- **Understanding Polyfill:**
  - A polyfill is a piece of code (typically JavaScript on the web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.
  - Creating a polyfill for the `bind` method helps ensure consistent behavior across different JavaScript environments.

- **Creating a Polyfill for bind:**
  - You can create a polyfill by defining the `bind` method if it doesn't already exist on the `Function.prototype`.

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
  Function.prototype.bind = function(context, ...args) {
    // Store the reference to the original function
    const fn = this;

    // Return a new function
    return function(...newArgs) {
      // Combine the arguments passed to bind with those passed to the new function
      const combinedArgs = args.concat(newArgs);

      // Call the original function with the correct context and combined arguments
      return fn.apply(context, combinedArgs);
    };
  };
}
```

- **Explanation of the Polyfill:**
  - The polyfill checks if `Function.prototype.bind` is not already defined.
  - It defines the `bind` method on `Function.prototype`, allowing it to be available on all function instances.
  - The `bind` method takes a `context` (the `this` value) and optional initial arguments (`...args`).
  - The original function (`fn`) is stored, and a new function is returned.
  - When the new function is called, it combines the initial arguments with any new arguments and calls the original function with the specified `this` context and combined arguments using `apply`.

- **Use Case Example:**
  - The polyfill can be used to ensure consistent `this` binding in environments where `Function.prototype.bind` is not natively supported.

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
  console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name + punctuation);
}

const person = { name: 'John' };

const greetPerson = greet.bind(person, 'Hello');
greetPerson('!'); // Output: Hello, John!
```

- **Explanation of Use Case:**
  - The `greet` function uses `this.name` to reference a name property.
  - Using the polyfill, `greet` is bound to the `person` object with the initial argument 'Hello'.
  - Calling `greetPerson` with '!' outputs 'Hello, John!' as expected.

### Debouncing vs Throttling | Walmart UI Interview Question

#### Key Insights

**Debouncing**
- **Definition**: Ensures that a function is only called once after a specified period of inactivity.
- **Use Case**: Useful for events that trigger multiple times rapidly (e.g., keystrokes, window resizing).
- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  function debounce(func, delay) {
    let debounceTimer;
    return function() {
      const context = this;
      const args = arguments;
      clearTimeout(debounceTimer);
      debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(context, args), delay);
    };
  }
  // Usage example
  const handleResize = () => {
    console.log('Window resized');
  };
  window.addEventListener('resize', debounce(handleResize, 300));
  ```

**Throttling**
- **Definition**: Ensures that a function is called at most once every specified period.
- **Use Case**: Useful for events that can fire frequently and need regular intervals between executions (e.g., scrolling, mouse movements).
- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  function throttle(func, limit) {
    let lastFunc;
    let lastRan;
    return function() {
      const context = this;
      const args = arguments;
      if (!lastRan) {
        func.apply(context, args);
        lastRan = Date.now();
      } else {
        clearTimeout(lastFunc);
        lastFunc = setTimeout(function() {
          if ((Date.now() - lastRan) >= limit) {
            func.apply(context, args);
            lastRan = Date.now();
          }
        }, limit - (Date.now() - lastRan));
      }
    };
  }
  // Usage example
  const handleScroll = () => {
    console.log('Scroll event');
  };
  window.addEventListener('scroll', throttle(handleScroll, 200));
  ```

**Comparison**
- **Debouncing**: Ensures a function is called after a delay period of inactivity. It's suitable for actions triggered by user inputs where the final action should happen only after the user has stopped typing or performing the activity.
- **Throttling**: Ensures a function is called at regular intervals, preventing it from being called too often. It's suitable for performance-intensive actions that need to happen regularly but not too frequently.

**Interview Tips**
- Understand the specific use cases for each technique.
- Be able to explain the differences clearly and provide real-world examples.
- Be prepared to write and explain the implementations during the interview.

### Call, Apply, and Bind Method in JavaScript

**Key Insights:**

- **`call()` Method:**
  - **Definition**: Invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.
  - **Usage**: Useful when you need to change the `this` context of a function and pass arguments separately.
  - **Syntax**: `functionName.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const person = {
        fullName: function() {
            return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
    };
    const person1 = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe"
    };
    console.log(person.fullName.call(person1)); // Output: John Doe
    ```

- **`apply()` Method:**
  - **Definition**: Invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.
  - **Usage**: Similar to `call()`, but arguments are passed as an array, making it useful for functions like `Math.max` that expect an array of arguments.
  - **Syntax**: `functionName.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])`
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const person = {
        fullName: function(city, country) {
            return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + city + ", " + country;
        }
    };
    const person1 = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe"
    };
    console.log(person.fullName.apply(person1, ["Oslo", "Norway"])); // Output: John Doe, Oslo, Norway
    ```

- **`bind()` Method:**
  - **Definition**: Creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
  - **Usage**: Useful for setting a fixed `this` context for a function, especially for callback functions.
  - **Syntax**: `functionName.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        fullName: function() {
            return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
    };
    const person1 = {
        firstName: "Mary",
        lastName: "Smith"
    };
    const boundFullName = person.fullName.bind(person1);
    console.log(boundFullName()); // Output: Mary Smith
    ```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Polyfill for `bind()` Method**:
  - A polyfill is a piece of code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.
  - **Polyfill Example**:
    ```javascript
    if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
        Function.prototype.bind = function(oThis) {
            if (typeof this !== "function") {
                throw new TypeError("Function.prototype.bind - what is trying to be bound is not callable");
            }
            var aArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1),
                fToBind = this,
                fNOP = function() {},
                fBound = function() {
                    return fToBind.apply(this instanceof fNOP && oThis
                        ? this
                        : oThis,
                        aArgs.concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)));
                };
            fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;
            fBound.prototype = new fNOP();
            return fBound;
        };
    }
    ```

### Currying in Javascript | JS Interview Questions

**Key Insights:**

- **Definition of Currying:**
  - Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function takes multiple arguments one at a time, instead of all at once.
  - It transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument.

- **Benefits of Currying:**
  - Enhances code reusability.
  - Makes function composition easier.
  - Delays execution until all arguments are provided.

- **Implementation Methods:**
  - **Using `bind`:**
    - The `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

    ```javascript
    function multiply(a, b) {
      return a * b;
    }
    
    let multiplyByTwo = multiply.bind(this, 2);
    console.log(multiplyByTwo(3)); // Output: 6
    ```

  - **Using Closures:**
    - A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

    ```javascript
    function multiply(a) {
      return function(b) {
        return a * b;
      };
    }
    
    let multiplyByTwo = multiply(2);
    console.log(multiplyByTwo(3)); // Output: 6
    ```

- **Interview Question Example:**
  - Write a curried function for addition.

    ```javascript
    function add(a) {
      return function(b) {
        if (b) return add(a + b);
        return a;
      };
    }
    
    console.log(add(1)(2)(3)()); // Output: 6
    ```

**Summary:**
- Currying is a key concept in functional programming with benefits such as enhanced reusability and ease of function composition.
- Two main ways to achieve currying in JavaScript are through the `bind` method and closures.
- Understanding and being able to implement currying can be crucial for technical interviews.

### Async vs Defer Attributes in JavaScript | Ola Interview Question

#### Key Insights

- **Definition of `async` and `defer` Attributes:**
  - `async`: Script is downloaded asynchronously and executed as soon as it is available. It does not guarantee the order of execution with other scripts.
  - `defer`: Script is downloaded asynchronously but executed only after the HTML parsing is complete. It ensures scripts are executed in the order they appear in the document.

- **Differences Between `async` and `defer`:**
  - `async`:
    - Downloads the script while the HTML parsing is still ongoing.
    - Executes the script immediately after it is downloaded, possibly before HTML parsing is finished.
    - Does not guarantee execution order if multiple scripts have the `async` attribute.
  - `defer`:
    - Also downloads the script while the HTML parsing is ongoing.
    - Executes the script only after the HTML parsing is complete.
    - Guarantees execution order if multiple scripts have the `defer` attribute.

- **Usage Scenarios:**
  - Use `async` for scripts that do not depend on each other and can be executed as soon as they are downloaded.
  - Use `defer` for scripts that need to be executed in a specific order or rely on the DOM being fully parsed.

#### Code Snippets

**Example of `async` Attribute:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script async src="script1.js"></script>
  <script async src="script2.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Async Example</p>
</body>
</html>
```
- In this example, `script1.js` and `script2.js` are downloaded asynchronously and executed as soon as they are available. The execution order is not guaranteed.

**Example of `defer` Attribute:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script defer src="script1.js"></script>
  <script defer src="script2.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Defer Example</p>
</body>
</html>
```
- In this example, `script1.js` and `script2.js` are downloaded asynchronously but executed in the order they appear in the HTML document after the HTML parsing is complete.

By understanding and utilizing `async` and `defer` attributes effectively, developers can optimize script loading and improve page performance.

### Event Bubbling, Capturing aka Trickling in Javascript | Oyo UI/Frontend Interview Question

#### Key Insights:
- **Event Bubbling**: 
  - Events propagate from the innermost target element to the outer elements.
  - Event handlers are called starting from the target element and then up to its ancestors.
  
- **Event Capturing (Trickling)**:
  - Events propagate from the outermost element to the innermost target element.
  - Event handlers are called starting from the outer elements down to the target element.
  
- **Event Phases**:
  - **Capture Phase**: Events go from the window down to the target element.
  - **Target Phase**: The event reaches the target element.
  - **Bubble Phase**: Events bubble up from the target element to the window.

- **Event Listeners**:
  - You can specify whether an event listener should be executed during the capture phase by passing `true` as the third argument to `addEventListener`.
  - Default is `false`, which means the event listener will be executed during the bubble phase.

#### Code Snippets:

1. **Adding Event Listeners for Bubbling and Capturing**:
    ```javascript
    document.getElementById("myElement").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        console.log("Bubble phase");
    }, false); // false indicates bubbling phase

    document.getElementById("myElement").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        console.log("Capture phase");
    }, true); // true indicates capture phase
    ```

2. **Example of Event Propagation**:
    ```html
    <div id="parent">
        <div id="child">
            Click me
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

    ```javascript
    document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log("Parent clicked - Bubble phase");
    }, false);

    document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log("Child clicked - Bubble phase");
    }, false);

    document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log("Parent clicked - Capture phase");
    }, true);

    document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log("Child clicked - Capture phase");
    }, true);
    ```

#### Interview Tips:
- Be prepared to explain the difference between event bubbling and capturing with examples.
- Know how to add event listeners for both bubbling and capturing phases.
- Understand and explain the event propagation phases clearly.
- Practice writing code snippets that demonstrate event propagation behavior.

## Event Delegation in JavaScript | UI/Frontend Interview Question

### Key Insights

- **Event Delegation Definition**
  - Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a single event listener is added to a parent element to manage events for multiple child elements.
  - Instead of adding individual event listeners to each child element, the event listener is added to a common ancestor, leveraging event bubbling.

- **How Event Delegation Works**
  - When an event is triggered on a child element, it bubbles up to the parent element where the event listener is attached.
  - The parent element can then handle the event, often by checking the `event.target` to determine which child element triggered the event.

- **Benefits of Event Delegation**
  - **Improved Performance**: Reduces the number of event listeners, saving memory and improving performance, especially with a large number of child elements.
  - **Simplified Code**: Centralizes event handling, making the code easier to manage and maintain.
  - **Dynamic Elements Handling**: Works well with dynamically added elements, as the parent listener can handle new child elements without additional code.

### Code Snippets

#### Example of Event Delegation

```javascript
// HTML Structure
// <ul id="parent">
//     <li>Item 1</li>
//     <li>Item 2</li>
//     <li>Item 3</li>
// </ul>

// JavaScript Implementation
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    if (event.target && event.target.nodeName === 'LI') {
        console.log('List item ', event.target.innerText, ' was clicked.');
    }
});
```

#### Explanation of the Code
- **HTML Structure**: A simple unordered list with several list items.
- **Event Listener on Parent**: Adds a single event listener to the `ul` element with the id `parent`.
- **Event Target Check**: Inside the event handler, `event.target` is used to check if the clicked element is an `li` element.
- **Handling the Event**: If the condition is met, the text of the clicked list item is logged to the console.

### Interview Tips
- Be ready to explain how event delegation works and its benefits.
- Discuss scenarios where event delegation is particularly useful, such as handling clicks on dynamically generated elements.
- Provide examples of how event delegation simplifies code and improves performance compared to adding individual event listeners.

### Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript | Frontend Interview Question

#### Key Insights

- **Prototype in JavaScript**:
  - Every JavaScript object has a prototype.
  - A prototype is also an object from which other objects inherit properties.

- **Prototypal Inheritance**:
  - Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype.
  - This inheritance is dynamic, meaning if you add a property to the prototype, it becomes available to all objects inheriting from it.

- **Prototype Chain**:
  - JavaScript uses a chain of prototypes to look for properties or methods that are called on objects.
  - If an object does not have a property or method, JavaScript looks for it in the prototype, and then in the prototype's prototype, and so on, until it finds it or reaches `null`.

#### Code Snippets

- **Creating an Object with a Prototype**:
  ```javascript
  function Person(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
  }

  Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  };

  const john = new Person('John', 30);
  john.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
  ```

- **Prototype Chain Example**:
  ```javascript
  const animal = {
      eats: true
  };

  const rabbit = {
      jumps: true
  };

  rabbit.__proto__ = animal; // Setting animal as the prototype of rabbit

  console.log(rabbit.eats); // true, because rabbit inherits eats from animal
  console.log(rabbit.jumps); // true
  ```

- **Understanding Prototype Chain**:
  ```javascript
  function A() {}
  A.prototype.greet = function() {
      return "Hello from A!";
  };

  function B() {}
  B.prototype = Object.create(A.prototype);

  const b = new B();
  console.log(b.greet()); // Output: Hello from A!
  ```
___
## Throttling in Javascript | Walmart Frontend Interview Question

### Key Insights:

- **What is Throttling?**
  - Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of an event handler, ensuring it only executes once in a specified time period, even if the event occurs multiple times.
  - It is particularly useful in scenarios like window resizing, scrolling, or network requests to prevent excessive function calls and improve performance.

- **Use Case of Throttling:**
  - Throttling can be used to limit the number of API calls, reducing server load and preventing rate limiting issues.
  - It helps in improving the performance of web applications by controlling the rate of execution of heavy computational tasks.

- **Throttling vs Debouncing:**
  - **Throttling** ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified time interval, regardless of how many times an event is triggered.
  - **Debouncing** ensures that a function is called only after a specified period of inactivity following the last event trigger.

### Code Snippets:

#### Throttle Function Implementation:
```javascript
function throttle(func, limit) {
    let lastFunc;
    let lastRan;
    return function(...args) {
        const context = this;
        if (!lastRan) {
            func.apply(context, args);
            lastRan = Date.now();
        } else {
            clearTimeout(lastFunc);
            lastFunc = setTimeout(function() {
                if ((Date.now() - lastRan) >= limit) {
                    func.apply(context, args);
                    lastRan = Date.now();
                }
            }, limit - (Date.now() - lastRan));
        }
    };
}
```

#### Example Usage:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', throttle(function() {
    console.log('Resized!');
}, 1000));
```

- **Explanation of Code:**
  - `throttle` function accepts two parameters: `func` (the function to throttle) and `limit` (time interval in milliseconds).
  - It maintains two variables: `lastFunc` (to store the timeout) and `lastRan` (to store the timestamp of the last execution).
  - The function returned by `throttle` checks if the function has been executed within the specified `limit`. If not, it executes the function immediately.
  - If the function has been executed recently, it sets a timeout to execute the function after the remaining time of the `limit` interval has passed.

### Additional Notes:
- **Polyfill for Throttling:**
  - A polyfill can be implemented for environments that do not support throttling natively, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Proper use of throttling can significantly improve the performance of web applications by reducing the number of function calls during high-frequency events.
- **Interview Tip:**
  - Be prepared to explain the differences between throttling and debouncing, and provide examples of when to use each technique during interviews.

### Local Storage & Session Storage [ with Code Examples ] - Key Insights and Code Snippets

#### Key Insights:

- **Web Storage API**: 
  - Used to store key-value pairs in a web browser.
  - Data is stored as strings.

- **Types of Web Storage**:
  - **Session Storage**:
    - Data persists only for the session duration.
    - Data is cleared when the browser window or tab is closed.
    - Does not send data to the server during network requests.
    - Capacity: At least 5MB.
  - **Local Storage**:
    - Data persists even after the browser is closed or the system is restarted.
    - Useful for storing user-specific data that does not need to be kept on the server.
    - Higher capacity than session storage and cookies.
    - Follows the same origin policy for security.

- **Same Origin Policy**:
  - Origin comprises the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), host (e.g., flipkart.com), and port (e.g., 8080).
  - Data in local storage is specific to the origin.
  - Changes in protocol, host, or port result in different storage spaces.

#### Code Snippets:

- **Setting Data in Local Storage**:
  ```javascript
  // Set item in local storage
  localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');

  // Example
  localStorage.setItem('hello', 'world');
  ```

- **Getting Data from Local Storage**:
  ```javascript
  // Get item from local storage
  const value = localStorage.getItem('key');

  // Example
  const helloValue = localStorage.getItem('hello');
  ```

- **Removing Data from Local Storage**:
  ```javascript
  // Remove specific item from local storage
  localStorage.removeItem('key');

  // Example
  localStorage.removeItem('hello');
  ```

- **Clearing All Data in Local Storage**:
  ```javascript
  // Clear all items from local storage
  localStorage.clear();
  ```

- **Storing Objects in Local Storage**:
  ```javascript
  // Convert object to string and store
  const user = { name: 'Akshay' };
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));

  // Retrieve and parse object from local storage
  const userStr = localStorage.getItem('user');
  const userObj = JSON.parse(userStr);
  ```

#### Best Practices for Machine Coding Rounds:

- **Create Helper Functions**:
  ```javascript
  // Helper function to set data
  function setLocalStorageData(key, value) {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  }

  // Helper function to get data
  function getLocalStorageData(key) {
    const value = localStorage.getItem(key);
    return value ? JSON.parse(value) : null;
  }

  // Usage example
  setLocalStorageData('user', { name: 'Akshay' });
  const user = getLocalStorageData('user');
  ```

- **Prepare Custom Library**:
  - Develop a small library of functions to handle local storage data transformations.
  - This will save time during interviews and coding rounds.

#### Practical Usage:
- Companies like Flipkart and Paytm use local storage for user-specific data, A/B testing, and performance optimization.
- Local storage is faster for data retrieval compared to network requests, enhancing page speed.

### Debouncing in Javascript | Flipkart UI Interview Question

**Key Insights:**

- **Definition:**
  - Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, improving the performance of web applications.
  - It limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.

- **Use Case:**
  - Commonly used in scenarios like handling search input, where the function should only trigger after the user has finished typing.

- **Implementation:**
  - A debounced function delays the processing of the keystroke events until the user has stopped typing for a predetermined amount of time.

**Debounce Function Implementation:**

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function(...args) {
    const context = this;
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(context, args), delay);
  };
}
```

- **Explanation of Code:**
  - `func`: The function to be debounced.
  - `delay`: The time in milliseconds to wait before executing the function.
  - `timer`: A variable to store the timeout reference.
  - `clearTimeout(timer)`: Clears the previous timeout, preventing the function from executing.
  - `setTimeout()`: Sets a new timeout to execute the function after the delay.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
// Function to fetch data from API
function getData() {
  console.log('Fetching data...');
}

// Debounced version of getData with a 300ms delay
const debouncedGetData = debounce(getData, 300);

// Event listener for input field
document.getElementById('search').addEventListener('keyup', debouncedGetData);
```

- **Explanation of Example:**
  - The `getData` function simulates fetching data from an API.
  - `debouncedGetData` is the debounced version of `getData` with a 300ms delay.
  - An event listener is added to the input field with ID `search`, invoking `debouncedGetData` on `keyup` events.

**Key Points to Remember:**
- Debouncing helps in optimizing performance by reducing the number of function calls.
- It is particularly useful in handling events that trigger multiple times in quick succession, such as keypresses or window resizing.

### sum(1)(2)(3)(4)..(n)() | Amazon UI/Frontend Javascript Interview Question - YouTube

#### Key Insights:
- **Understanding the Problem**:
  - Create a function that allows chaining calls with numbers and returns their sum when an empty call is made.
  - Example: `sum(1)(2)(3)()` should return 6.

- **Concept of First-Class Functions**:
  - Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects.
  - They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

- **Recursive Approach**:
  - Use recursion to handle the chaining of functions.
  - Each call returns a new function that takes another argument until the base case (empty call) is reached.

- **Base Case**:
  - The base case is when no argument is provided, indicating the end of the chain and the return of the computed sum.

#### Code Snippets:

##### Basic Recursive Solution:
```javascript
function sum(a) {
    return function(b) {
        if (b !== undefined) {
            return sum(a + b);
        } else {
            return a;
        }
    };
}

// Example Usage
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)()); // Output: 10
```

##### ES6 Syntax:
```javascript
const sum = a => b => b !== undefined ? sum(a + b) : a;

// Example Usage
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)()); // Output: 10
```

##### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Basic Structure**:
    - `sum` is a function that takes an argument `a` and returns another function.
    - The inner function takes an argument `b` and checks if `b` is `undefined`.
    - If `b` is not `undefined`, it recursively calls `sum` with the sum of `a` and `b`.
    - If `b` is `undefined`, it returns `a`.

2. **Recursive Pattern**:
    - This recursive call pattern continues until an empty call `()` is made.
    - When `()` is called, `b` is `undefined` and the current sum `a` is returned.

3. **Optimized Single Line ES6 Syntax**:
    - The ES6 arrow function syntax reduces the code to a single line.
    - It uses a ternary operator to handle the recursion and base case.
