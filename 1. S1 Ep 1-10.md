## How JavaScript Works üî•& Execution Context | Namaste JavaScript Ep.1 - YouTube

### Key Insights:

- **Execution Context**:
  - Everything in JavaScript happens inside the Execution Context.
  - The Execution Context can be visualized as a big box containing two components:
    1. **Memory Component (Variable Environment)**: 
       - Stores variables and functions as key-value pairs.
       - Example:
         ```javascript
         var a = 10; // 'a' is the key, 10 is the value
         ```
    2. **Code Component (Thread of Execution)**:
       - Executes code one line at a time.
       - Known as the Thread of Execution.

- **JavaScript Characteristics**:
  - **Synchronous Single-Threaded Language**:
    - Executes one command at a time in a specific order.
    - Moves to the next line only after the current line has finished executing.
  - Asynchronous operations (like AJAX) will be covered in future videos.

### Summary:
- **Execution Context**:
  - Consists of Memory Component and Code Component.
  - Memory Component is also known as Variable Environment.
  - Code Component is also known as Thread of Execution.
- **Key Points**:
  - JavaScript is synchronous and single-threaded.
  - Executes one command at a time in a specific order.


  # How JavaScript Code is Executed? ‚ù§Ô∏è & Call Stack | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 2

## Key Insights

### Execution Context
- **Execution Context:** Fundamental concept where all JavaScript code runs.
- **Components:**
  - **Memory Component:** Stores variables and function declarations.
  - **Code Component:** Executes the code line by line.

### Phases of Execution Context
1. **Memory Creation Phase:**
   - Allocates memory for variables and functions.
   - Variables initialized with `undefined`.
   - Functions stored with their entire code.

2. **Code Execution Phase:**
   - Executes code line by line.
   - Updates variable values from `undefined` to actual values.

### Example Code
```javascript
var n = 2;
function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```

### Execution Steps
1. **Global Execution Context (GEC):**
   - Memory allocation:
     - `n` -> `undefined`
     - `square` -> function code
     - `square2` -> `undefined`
     - `square4` -> `undefined`
   - Code execution:
     - `n = 2`
     - `square2 = square(2)`
     - `square4 = square(4)`

2. **Function Execution Context (FEC) for `square(n)` and `square(4)`:**
   - Memory allocation:
     - `num` -> `undefined`
     - `ans` -> `undefined`
   - Code execution:
     - `num = n` or `num = 4`
     - `ans = num * num`
     - Return `ans`

### Call Stack
- **Call Stack:** Manages the order of execution contexts.
  - **Push:** When a function is invoked, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the stack.
  - **Pop:** When a function completes, its execution context is popped from the stack.

### Example Call Stack Operations
- **Global Execution Context (GEC)**
  - **Push:** When program starts.
- **Function Execution Context (FEC)**
  - **Push:** When `square(n)` or `square(4)` is invoked.
  - **Pop:** When function execution completes and returns a value.

### Diagram for Call Stack

```plaintext
Initial Call Stack:
-------------------
| Global Execution Context (GEC) |
-------------------

After invoking square(n):
-------------------
| Function Execution Context (FEC) |
| Global Execution Context (GEC)   |
-------------------

After returning from square(n):
-------------------
| Global Execution Context (GEC) |
-------------------

After invoking square(4):
-------------------
| Function Execution Context (FEC) |
| Global Execution Context (GEC)   |
-------------------

After returning from square(4):
-------------------
| Global Execution Context (GEC) |
-------------------
```

### Key Concepts
- **Global Execution Context (GEC):** Created when the script starts.
- **Function Execution Context (FEC):** Created for each function invocation.
- **Memory Allocation:** Variables initialized with `undefined`.
- **Code Execution:** Variables assigned actual values, and functions executed.

### Call Stack Management
- **Execution Context Stack/Program Stack/Control Stack/Runtime Stack/Machine Stack:** Different names for the same concept (call stack).
- **Function Invocation:** Pushes new execution context onto the stack.
- **Function Return:** Pops the execution context off the stack.

This summary encapsulates the execution process of JavaScript code, providing a clear understanding of how execution contexts and the call stack operate.

## Hoisting in JavaScript üî•(variables & functions) | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 3

### Key Insights:
- **Hoisting Concept:**
  - JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
  - Allows functions and variables to be used before they are declared.
  - Two phases in JavaScript execution: Memory Creation and Execution.

- **Memory Creation Phase:**
  - During this phase, JavaScript allocates memory for all variables and functions.
  - Variables are assigned a special value `undefined`.
  - Functions are stored with their entire definition.

- **Execution Phase:**
  - The code is executed line by line.
  - Variables are assigned their actual values.
  - Functions are available throughout the code.

### Example 1: Variable Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 7;
console.log(x); // Output: 7
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `var x` is hoisted to the top, so the first `console.log(x)` prints `undefined`.
  - After assignment, `console.log(x)` prints `7`.

### Example 2: Function Hoisting

```javascript
getName(); // Output: "Namaste JavaScript"
function getName() {
    console.log("Namaste JavaScript");
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The function `getName` is hoisted with its definition.
  - Calling `getName` before its declaration works because of hoisting.

### Example 3: Hoisting with `let` and `const`

```javascript
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
let y = 10;
console.log(y); // Output: 10

console.log(z); // ReferenceError: z is not defined
const z = 20;
console.log(z); // Output: 20
```

- **Explanation:**
  - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized.
  - Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

### Detailed Behavior:

- **Variable Hoisting:**
  - Variables declared with `var` are initialized with `undefined`.
  - `let` and `const` variables are not initialized, leading to a `ReferenceError` if accessed before declaration.

- **Function Hoisting:**
  - Function declarations are hoisted with their definitions.
  - Function expressions and arrow functions behave like variables and are initialized with `undefined`.

### Practical Tips:
- Understand the difference between `undefined` and `not defined`:
  - `undefined`: Variable declared but not assigned a value.
  - `not defined`: Variable not declared at all.

- **Interview Answer:**
  - Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of the scope.
  - This includes both variable and function declarations.
  - Variables declared with `var` are initialized to `undefined`, while `let` and `const` are not initialized, causing a `ReferenceError` if accessed before declaration.

# How functions work in JS ‚ù§Ô∏è & Variable Environment | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 4 - YouTube

### Key Insights:

- **Function Invocation and Variable Environment:**
  - When a function is invoked, it creates an **execution context**.
  - The execution context has two components: **Memory (Variable Environment)** and **Code (Thread of Execution)**.

- **Execution Context:**
  - When a function is called, JavaScript creates a new execution context for that function.
  - This context contains all the local variables and functions defined within that function.
  - Each function call creates a new execution context, independent of others.

- **Variable Environment:**
  - The variable environment stores the function's local variables.
  - Variables are initially set to `undefined` during the creation phase.

### Code Snippets:

#### Example of Function Invocation and Execution Context:

```javascript
function outer() {
    var a = 10;
    function inner() {
        var b = 20;
        console.log(a + b); // 30
    }
    inner();
}

outer();
```

- **Explanation:**
  - When `outer` is invoked, an execution context is created for it.
  - `outer`'s context contains the variable `a`.
  - When `inner` is invoked within `outer`, a new execution context is created for `inner`.
  - `inner`'s context contains the variable `b` and has access to `outer`'s variables due to the scope chain.

#### Variable Hoisting:

```javascript
function example() {
    console.log(x); // undefined
    var x = 5;
    console.log(x); // 5
}

example();
```

- **Explanation:**
  - During the creation phase, `var x` is hoisted to the top of the function scope.
  - Initially, `x` is set to `undefined`.
  - After the assignment `x = 5`, `x` now holds the value `5`.

#### Function Scope and Closure:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    var outerVar = 'I am outside!';
    
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVar); // I am outside!
    }
    
    return innerFunction;
}

var myFunction = outerFunction();
myFunction();
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `innerFunction` is a closure that captures `outerVar` from its lexical scope.
  - Even after `outerFunction` has finished executing, `innerFunction` retains access to `outerVar`.

### Important Points:

- **Memory Allocation:**
  - Before execution, memory is allocated for variables and functions. Variables are initialized to `undefined`.

- **Execution Phase:**
  - The JavaScript engine executes the code line by line.

- **Independent Execution Contexts:**
  - Each function invocation creates a new, independent execution context with its own memory space.

# SHORTEST JS Program üî•window & this keyword | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 5

## Key Insights

- **Global Context in JavaScript**
  - In JavaScript, the global context is represented by the `window` object in browsers.
  - All global variables and functions are properties of the `window` object.

- **Creating Variables and Functions in Global Scope**
  - When you create a variable or a function in the global scope, it becomes a property of the `window` object.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    var myVar = 'Hello';
    function myFunction() {
      console.log('Hello World');
    }
    console.log(window.myVar); // Outputs: Hello
    window.myFunction(); // Outputs: Hello World
    ```

- **The `this` Keyword in Global Context**
  - In the global execution context, `this` refers to the `window` object.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    console.log(this === window); // Outputs: true
    ```

- **Understanding `window` Object**
  - The `window` object represents the browser window and provides methods to interact with the browser, like `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()`.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    window.alert('Hello, World!'); // Displays an alert box with the message
    ```

- **Global Object in Non-Browser Environments**
  - In environments like Node.js, the global object is not `window` but `global`.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    console.log(global); // Outputs the global object in Node.js
    ```

## Important Code Snippets

- **Global Variables and Functions**
  ```javascript
  var name = 'Akshay';
  function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + name);
  }
  console.log(window.name); // Outputs: Akshay
  window.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, Akshay
  ```

- **Using `this` in Global Context**
  ```javascript
  console.log(this); // Outputs: window object
  console.log(this === window); // Outputs: true
  ```

- **Global Object in Node.js**
  ```javascript
  global.myGlobalVar = 'I am a global variable';
  console.log(global.myGlobalVar); // Outputs: I am a global variable
  ```

These insights and code snippets can help you understand the global context, `window` object, and `this` keyword in JavaScript, which are essential topics often discussed in interviews.

# undefined vs not defined in JS ü§î | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 6

### Key Insights

- **Global Execution Context**:
  - JavaScript creates a global execution context and allocates memory to all variables and functions before executing any code.
  
- **undefined vs not defined**:
  - `undefined`:
    - A special keyword in JavaScript indicating a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
    - Takes up memory as a placeholder.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      var a;
      console.log(a); // Output: undefined
      a = 7;
      console.log(a); // Output: 7
      ```
  - `not defined`:
    - Refers to variables that have not been declared.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      console.log(x); // Output: ReferenceError: x is not defined
      ```

- **JavaScript's Loose Typing**:
  - JavaScript is a loosely typed (or weakly typed) language, meaning variables are not bound to a specific data type.
  - A variable can hold any type of value at different points in time.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    var a;
    console.log(a); // Output: undefined
    a = 10;
    console.log(a); // Output: 10
    a = "hello";
    console.log(a); // Output: hello
    ```

- **Avoid Assigning undefined**:
  - It is generally a bad practice to assign `undefined` directly to a variable.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    var a;
    a = undefined; // Not recommended
    console.log(a); // Output: undefined
    ```

### Code Snippets

- **Checking undefined**:
  ```javascript
  var a;
  if (a === undefined) {
      console.log("a is undefined");
  } else {
      console.log("a is not undefined");
  }
  ```

- **Loose Typing Example**:
  ```javascript
  var a;
  console.log(a); // Output: undefined
  
  a = 10;
  console.log(a); // Output: 10
  
  a = "hello";
  console.log(a); // Output: hello
  ```

- **Avoid Assigning undefined**:
  ```javascript
  var a;
  a = undefined; // Not recommended
  console.log(a); // Output: undefined
  ```

### Summary

- `undefined` is used by JavaScript as a placeholder for variables that have been declared but not assigned a value.
- `not defined` refers to variables that have not been declared at all.
- JavaScript's loose typing allows variables to hold any type of value.
- Avoid directly assigning `undefined` to variables as it is considered a bad practice.

# The Scope Chain, üî•Scope & Lexical Environment | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 7

## Key Insights

### Lexical Environment
- **Definition**: A data structure that holds identifier-variable mapping.
- **Components**:
  - **Environment Record**: Stores variables and function declarations.
  - **Reference to Outer Environment**: Points to the parent lexical environment.

### Scope Chain
- **Scope**: The current context of execution.
- **Scope Chain**: A list of references to lexical environments, starting from the current context and going up to the global context.

### Execution Context
- **Creation**:
  - **Global Execution Context**: Created when the script starts.
  - **Function Execution Context**: Created when a function is invoked.
- **Parts**:
  - **Variable Object (VO)**: Contains function arguments, inner variable and function declarations.
  - **Scope Chain**: Points to the lexical environment.
  - **This**: References the current object.

### How JavaScript Finds Variables
1. **Variable Lookup**: Searches in the current lexical environment.
2. **Outer Environment Reference**: Moves up the scope chain if not found.
3. **Global Environment**: If the variable is not found in any lexical environment.

### Code Snippets

#### Example of Lexical Environment and Scope Chain

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  var outerVar = 'I am outside!';
  
  function innerFunction() {
    var innerVar = 'I am inside!';
    console.log(outerVar); // Accesses outerVar from the outer lexical environment
  }
  
  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
// Output: 'I am outside!'
```

#### Execution Context Creation

```javascript
var a = 10;

function foo() {
  var b = 20;
  
  function bar() {
    var c = 30;
    console.log(a, b, c); // Accesses a from global, b from foo, and c from bar
  }
  
  bar();
}

foo();
// Output: 10, 20, 30
```

### Variable Hoisting
- **Definition**: JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope.
- **Example**:

```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined due to hoisting
var x = 5;

function hoistExample() {
  console.log(y); // undefined due to hoisting
  var y = 10;
}

hoistExample();
```

### Closures
- **Definition**: A function that retains access to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.
- **Example**:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

## Summary
- **Lexical Environment**: The structure containing variable bindings.
- **Scope Chain**: Chain of lexical environments to resolve variables.
- **Execution Context**: Contains variable object, scope chain, and 'this'.
- **Variable Lookup**: Starts from current context and moves up the scope chain.
- **Hoisting**: Variables and function declarations are moved to the top.
- **Closures**: Functions that maintain access to their lexical scope.

## let & const in JS üî•Temporal Dead Zone | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 8

### Key Insights:

- **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**
  - The TDZ is the period from the start of the block until the variable declaration is encountered.
  - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are in the TDZ from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.

- **let vs const**
  - `let` allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement.
  - `const` allows you to declare variables whose values are constant within the block scope.

- **Hoisting**
  - `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
  - `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted but not initialized.
  - Accessing `let` and `const` variables before their declaration will result in a ReferenceError due to being in the TDZ.

- **Example of TDZ with let and const**
  ```javascript
  console.log(a); // undefined
  var a = 10;

  console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
  let b = 20;

  console.log(c); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization
  const c = 30;
  ```

- **Scope of let and const**
  - Block-scoped variables are not properties of the global object.
  - They exist in a separate block scope.

- **Using const**
  - `const` variables must be initialized at the time of declaration.
  - They cannot be reassigned, but their properties (if an object) can be modified.

### Code Snippets:

- **Using let in a block scope**
  ```javascript
  if (true) {
      let a = 10;
      console.log(a); // 10
  }
  console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
  ```

- **Using const with objects**
  ```javascript
  const obj = { name: "John" };
  obj.name = "Jane"; // Allowed
  console.log(obj.name); // "Jane"

  const obj = {}; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'obj' has already been declared
  ```

- **Temporal Dead Zone Example**
  ```javascript
  console.log(temp); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'temp' before initialization
  let temp = "I'm in TDZ until this line";
  console.log(temp); // "I'm in TDZ until this line"
  ```

These insights and code snippets will help you understand the nuances of `let` and `const` declarations in JavaScript, including the concept of the Temporal Dead Zone, scope, and hoisting. They are crucial for answering interview questions on the topic effectively.

# BLOCK SCOPE & Shadowing in JS üî• | Namaste JavaScript üôè Ep. 9 - YouTube

## Key Insights

- **Block Scope in JavaScript:**
  - **Definition**: A block is a compound statement that groups multiple JavaScript statements together.
  - **Usage**: Blocks are used to combine multiple statements where JavaScript expects only one statement.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    {
        // This is a block
        let x = 10;
        const y = 20;
        console.log(x + y);
    }
    ```

- **Why Use Blocks**: 
  - Blocks help in grouping statements to control scope and manage the execution of multiple statements as a single unit.
  - They are particularly useful in control structures like `if`, `for`, and `while` statements.

- **Variable Shadowing**:
  - **Definition**: Shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a block has the same name as a variable declared outside the block.
  - **Effect**: The inner variable shadows (or hides) the outer variable within the block.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    let x = 10;
    {
        let x = 20; // This x shadows the outer x
        console.log(x); // Outputs 20
    }
    console.log(x); // Outputs 10
    ```

- **Block Scope with `let` and `const`**:
  - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
  - They are not accessible outside the block in which they are declared.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    {
        let a = 5;
        const b = 10;
        console.log(a + b); // Outputs 15
    }
    console.log(a); // Error: a is not defined
    console.log(b); // Error: b is not defined
    ```

- **Lexical Environment and Scope Chain**:
  - **Lexical Environment**: Refers to the structure holding variable bindings at a particular execution context.
  - **Scope Chain**: A chain of Lexical Environments where the variable is looked up when it is used.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    let x = 10;
    function foo() {
        let y = 20;
        {
            let z = 30;
            console.log(x + y + z); // Outputs 60
        }
        console.log(x + y); // Outputs 30
    }
    foo();
    ```

- **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**:
  - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are not hoisted in the same way as `var`.
  - Accessing them before their declaration results in a ReferenceError.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    console.log(a); // Error: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
    let a = 5;
    ```

- **Practical Usage**:
  - Understanding block scope and variable shadowing is crucial for writing clean and bug-free code.
  - Helps in managing variable lifetimes and preventing unintentional variable modification.

By understanding these concepts, you can write more predictable and maintainable JavaScript code.

# Closures in JS üî• | Namaste JavaScript Episode 10

## Key Insights

- **Definition**: A closure is a function bundled together with its lexical environment.
- **Lexical Scope**: Closures capture variables from their surrounding scope.
- **Usage**: Useful for data privacy and creating function factories.

## Code Snippets

### Basic Example of Closure

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 100;
    
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    }
    
    return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // Outputs: 100
```

### Practical Example: Counter Function

```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    
    return function() {
        count++;
        return count;
    }
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 1
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 2
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 3
```

### Explanation

- **outerFunction** creates a local variable `outerVariable` and an `innerFunction`.
- `innerFunction` is returned, maintaining access to `outerVariable` even after `outerFunction` has finished execution.
- This allows `innerFunction` to reference and use `outerVariable` whenever it is called.

### Advanced Usage: Function Factories

```javascript
function createAdder(x) {
    return function(y) {
        return x + y;
    }
}

const addFive = createAdder(5);
console.log(addFive(3)); // Outputs: 8
console.log(addFive(10)); // Outputs: 15
```

- **createAdder** takes a number `x` and returns a new function that adds `x` to another number `y`.
- The returned function remembers the value of `x` from its creation scope, illustrating closure.

## Interview Tips

- **Explain Closures Clearly**: Describe a closure as a combination of a function and its lexical scope.
- **Use Examples**: Show simple and practical examples, like a counter or adder function.
- **Emphasize Benefits**: Highlight data encapsulation, factory functions, and maintaining state in asynchronous programming.
